# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to display the weather conditions of any city that a user submits into the search bar. The user can also get the conditions of eight popular cities automatically by pressing the respective buttons. This website uses server-side API (Application Programming Interface) from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/). Once the user submits a city, the UV index will be color-coded to indicate the degree to which the UV conditions are favorable; from most favorable to dangerous, the colors are green, yellow, orange, red, and purple. The condions for the following five days are displayed below those of the current day.
