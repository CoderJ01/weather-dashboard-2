# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to display the weather conditions of any city that a user submits into the search bar. The user can also get the conditions of eight popular cities automatically by pressing the respective buttons. This website uses server-side API (Application Programming Interface) from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/). Once the user submits a city, the UV index will be color-coded to indicate the degree to which the UV conditions are favorable; from most favorable to dangerous, the colors are green, yellow, orange, red, and purple. The conditions for the following five days are displayed below those of the current day. The dashboard can also store up to 12 cities in the search history, which will appear below the grey city buttons after the page is refreshed.

## Challenges
For a novice programmer, the creation of a dashboard such as this one is a formidable undertaking. Through independent research of server-side APIs, said programmer will likely find out that API keys are generally best hidden. Some sites charge a user for the use of certain API keys. These keys can be stolen and maliciously used by unethical individuals. Should the programmer mistakenly push the keys onto GitHub or the like, the coder can delete the commits with the keys or set the repository to private and create another repository to showcase.

However, if the API is free and the user can generate another one from the personal account the API comes from, then temporarily exposing it for showcase isn't detrimental.

Luckily, the API used for this repository can be rendered useless via the generation or another one via Open Weather. Upon my discovery of this, I set weather-dashboard (first version, [commits](https://github.com/CoderJ01/weather-dashboard/commits/main) here) to be viewed publicly.
